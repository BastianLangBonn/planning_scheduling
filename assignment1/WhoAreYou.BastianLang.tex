Bastian Lang

\section{Your background}
I studied computer science at the university of Bonn (Diplom) and did some minor programming jobs as a student worker there. Afterwards I worked as a software engineer (JAVA) for two different companies for two and a half years.

\section{Why you are interested in this course}
I am very interested in artificial intelligence and intelligent systems. I imagine this course to be about the application of search algorithms and logical reasoning to robotic systems for planning and scheduling purposes.

\section{What you would like to get out of it}
I learned about logic and search algorithms before, but I never actually used them to solve some actual problems besides some example toy problems. I would like to know how to actually use them within a robot architecture and which approaches to use in which situations. Additionally I would like to learn what mechanisms current robot architectures use to approach planning tasks.
